# Wireframing

## Introduction

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a basic visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or application. It focuses on the layout, structure, and placement of key elements, helping teams plan functionality and user interactions before adding design details like colors, images, or fonts.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing is a critical step in the design process because:
- ✅ It translates abstract ideas into tangible visual structures.
- ✅ It helps identify usability issues early, before time is spent on detailed design or development.
- ✅ It provides a clear communication tool for designers, developers, and stakeholders.
- ✅ It ensures that navigation, content hierarchy, and functionality are well thought out from the start.

By focusing on structure rather than style, wireframes help teams build a strong foundation for successful, user-friendly products.
